Examples
========

Here we show a range of examples utilizing `PathSim` to simulate different dynamical systems and how to implement them step by step, starting from the system definition. For more fine grained explanations of the different analysis methods, settings, functionalities of `PathSim`, have a look at the :ref:`ref-tutorials`.

There is an even more comprehensive collection of example dynamical system simulations availabe in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/milanofthe/pathsim/blob/master/examples>`_.


.. note::
   Examples are available as interactive Jupyter notebooks that can be downloaded and executed directly.
