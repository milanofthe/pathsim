Examples
========

Here we show a range of examples utilizing `PathSim` to simulate different dynamical systems and how to implement them step by step, starting from the system definition.

There is an even more comprehensive collection of example dynamical system simulations availabe in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/milanofthe/pathsim/blob/master/examples>`_.


.. note::
   Examples are available as interactive Jupyter notebooks that can be downloaded and executed directly.
