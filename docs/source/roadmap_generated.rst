         <p>I'm currently playing around with the new RFNetwork block. It seems to work, but there are strange effects and the numbers are not quite right.<br><br>Now, I'm wondering if my issues have anything to do with the port mapping, which is actually very unclear to me. [In the docs](https://pathsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/pathsim.blocks.rf.html) it reads "*Assumes N inputs and N outputs, where N is t...</p>

         <p>PathSim already supports adding and activating/deactivating blocks and connections at simulation runtime. For example through events.

         <p>PathSim has a decentralized architecture for the blocks which lends itself to parallelism and asynchronizity. Expensive blocks should compute asynchronously and not make the other blocks wait. With free-threading from Python 3.13, parallelization of the block updates is possible and has been verified with multiprocessing (slow but validation of the concept) for an earlier build.<br><br>Near linear scali...</p>

         <p>Using exponential integrators is a way to eliminate stiffness from linear dynamical systems.
