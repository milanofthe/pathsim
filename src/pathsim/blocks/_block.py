# BASE BLOCK CLASS ======================================================================

class Block(Serializable):
    """Base 'Block' object that defines the inputs, outputs and the connect method.

    Block interconnections are handeled via the io interface of the blocks. 
    It is realized by dicts for the 'inputs' and for the 'outputs', where the 
    key of the dict is the input/output channel and the corresponding value is 
    the input/output value. 

    The block can spawn discrete events that are handled by the main simulation 
    for triggers, discrete time blocks, etc.

    Mathematically the block behavior is defined by two operators in most cases

    .. math::
    
        \\begin{eqnarray}
        \\dot{x} &= f_\\mathrm{dyn}(x, u, t)\\\\
               y &= f_\\mathrm{alg}(x, u, t)
        \\end{eqnarray}


    they are algebraic operators for the algebraic path of the block and for the 
    dynamic path that feeds into the internal numerical integration engine.

    There are special cases where one or both of them are not defined, also for 
    purely algebraic blocks such as multipliers and functions, there exists a 
    simplified operator definition:
    
    .. math::

        y = f_\\mathrm{alg}(u)
    

    Note
    ----
    This block is not intended to be used directly and serves as a base 
    class definition for other blocks to be inherited.
