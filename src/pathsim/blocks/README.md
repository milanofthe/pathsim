# Block Library

This is the place where the blocks are defined. All blocks inherent bas `Block` class from `_block.py` and implement the specific methods for the block behavior. The blocks are grouped thematically into modules. Standard blocks can be imported directly from the block library like this:

```python
from pathsim.blocks import Adder, Amplifier
```

Or from the respective module:

```python
from pathsim.blocks.adder import Adder
from pathsim.blockd.amplifier import Amplifier
```

---

The goal is to keep the available blocks that can be imported direcly general purpose and have separate submodules / toolboxes for special purpose blocks. For example for different domains such as chemical, tritium sciences, radio-frequency engineering, or robotics.
